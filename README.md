# Valorant-Gamestates
Gamestates, or phases, of a typical Valorant game.

In the main hub, the file "Valorant Gamestates" provides a brief overview of each phase of a Valorant game, including both Attackers and Defenders.

They are ordered correctly in the Valorant Gamestates.md file, and *should* link correctly to a file for each phase, which goes into further detail.

However, the files as they exist in the Attackers folder, Defenders folder, and Both folder, are **not** ordered properly.

# Valorant-Gamestates
Gamestates, or phases, of a typical Valorant game.

In the main hub, the file "**Valorant Gamestates**" provides a brief overview of each phase of a Valorant game, including both Attackers and Defenders.

They are ordered correctly in the Valorant Gamestates.md file. You can locate specific files in the corresponding folders, that go into further detail of each phase.

However, the files as they exist in the Attackers folder, Defenders folder, and Both folder, are **not** ordered properly.

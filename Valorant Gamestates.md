What are the *gamestates*, or *phases*, of every game of Valorant? What strategies are to be implemented during them?

**Vocabulary**
	**Entry Point**: Location on the map that connects to the site. Location that will have to be entered in order to get on site.
	**Utilities**: Character abilities that provide some kind of advantage (ie, a smoke that blocks an enemies line of sight).
	**Intel**: Information, likely about where an enemy is/may be.
	**Entry**: The process of getting onto a site.
	**Peak**: Turn a corner to gain line of sight on an otherwise unseeable area.
	**Flank**: Be positionally behind an enemy.
	**Bait**: Tempt an enemy towards a particular action.

##### Attackers
**[[Buy Phase]]**
	Buy weapons/armor
	Figure out starting strat
	Adapt your position during other phases in accordance to what you bought
**[[Pre-Entry]]**
	Phase before you enter site
	Take control of the area between you and the site
	Cover wherever you think enemies may peak you from
**[[Entry]]**
	When you enter the site
	Cover most likely enemy positions with smoke and/or crosshair
	Gather intel on enemy locations
**[[Plant]]**
	Plant the spike
	Cover most likely enemy positions, as they will try to peak
	Short duration
**[[Post-plant]]**
	After spike is planted
	Cover site entry point
	Do so quickly
**[[Interrupt Defuse]]**
	When enemies end up on site and start defusing
	You will hear the defuse start
	Enemies may or may not continue defusing
	Likely will have to [[Entry]] again
	Can fake [[Entry]] with utilities to stall - though it is risky


##### Defenders
**[[Buy Phase]]**
	Buy weapons/armor
	Figure out starting strat
	Adapt your position during other phases in accordance to what you bought
**[[Positional Set-up]]**
	Find position/entry point to cover and set-up for the intel phase
**[[Intel Phase]]**
	Phase after walls drop/buy phase is over
	Seek to gather information and cover an entry point
	May opt to peak for info or quick kill
	May aggressively move into an entry point position to cheese kills - though you will likely die
	Consider positions where you *hear* the enemy coming, rather than seeing them
**[[Rotational Phase]]**
	Starts when you know where enemies are/are planning to push
	Either rotate, or fall back on site to cover entry point
	Can flank to cheese a kill - though it is risky, you will need to fall back and rotate after
**[[Entry]]**
	When you enter the site
	Cover most likely enemy positions with smoke and/or crosshair
	Gather intel on enemy locations
**[[Defuse]]**
	Likely will have to [[Entry]]
	Bait the enemies by starting defuse, cancelling, then covering entry point

This phase happens once you *know* where the enemies are planning to push.

You will either rotate, or move onto your site into a position that covers an entry point.

You also may flank to cheese a kill - though not only might an enemy be covering flank, but if you *do* get a kill, they will know your position, and so you will have to fall back and rotate.

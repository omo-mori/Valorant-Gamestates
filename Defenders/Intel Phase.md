The intel phase starts once the buy timer goes off, and the walls go down. You will want to gather information as to what site the enemy seeks to push.

You may also peak to either get information, or to pick an enemy off.

You may also aggressively move into an entry point to cheese a kill or two - just keep in mind this is risky, as they will almost certainly be entering with multiple people (meaning you WILL die.)

Consider positions where you might *hear* the enemy coming, rather then *see* them.

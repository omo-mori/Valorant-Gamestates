If you have not killed the enemies during [[Post-plant]], and they end up on site - they will have to defuse. You will hear them start - they may or may not continue their defuse after starting.

During this phase, it is likely that you will have to [[Entry]] again - it is good to have utilities during this phase. 

If you have a utility, you may also stall by faking an entry to get them to stop planting. This is risky, because if they continue planting they may defuse.
